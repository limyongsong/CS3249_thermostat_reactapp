This project was created using Create React App to test a single page app that simulates a thermostat.
Code that are worked on can be found in /src

Custom events are done in SlidertextView.jsx and CurrenttextView.jsx/ NotCheckedtoTestTemp.jsx
My Github link: https://github.com/limyongsong/CS3249_thermostat_reactapp
No UI elements from other people was used, UI elements for this project was built using SVG shapes
Brief description:
Only the files within src/ were changed from 'React Create App'
src/view contains all the Views and Viewmodels
src/model contains all the Models
src/index.js compiles and creates the web app
-File structure follows the class diagram, with the exception of radialslider not being finished (which is replaced with a simple textbox component) [customEvents is still done in the CurrenttextView.jsx]
...More details in the Assignment 3 Report

No additional libraries/ installations are used outside of "React Create App"
Below are standard information on how to run "React Create Apps"
---
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
